    "|---------|----------|\n",
    "| Interface won't load | Check if Ollama is running (`ollama serve`) |\n",
    "| No response from AI | Verify your model is downloaded (`ollama list`) |\n",
    "| Slow responses | Try a smaller model like `gemma:2b` |\n",

    "- **Response time** depends on your hardware and model size\n",
    "- **Streaming** provides real-time feedback during generation\n",
